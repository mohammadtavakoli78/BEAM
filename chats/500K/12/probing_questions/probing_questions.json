As your productivity targets increased, particularly your daily writing output and video editing practice, you evaluated more powerful options including the MacBook Air M2 and Dell XPS 13, weighing processor capabilities, RAM, display quality, and operating system compatibility. You also factored in portability for travel and extended use during research trips. Throughout this period, you implemented structured workflows for writing and video editing, incorporating time-blocking, goal setting, and the use of specialized software like Final Cut Pro. After installing an external GPU, you achieved a 25% increase in video editing speed, which further enhanced your efficiency. You continuously assessed your progress against deadlines, adjusting your schedules and task prioritization to stay on track for projects such as documentary editing and presentation preparation. Your decision-making process balanced technical specifications, budget constraints, and practical considerations like software ecosystems and warranty options. Ultimately, your journey reflects a sophisticated integration of hardware choices, productivity strategies, and skill development, enabling you to meet ambitious goals while maintaining well-being and adaptability.",
