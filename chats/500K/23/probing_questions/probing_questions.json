You then requested detailed recipes to facilitate meal preparation, which included balanced options for all meals and snacks.

You also integrated family-shared recipes like bone broth into meal plans, recognizing their health benefits and frequency of consumption. Additionally, you considered incorporating plant-based protein powders into your diet and smoothies, evaluating their benefits and how they complement your nutritional goals.
