Items were sorted into categories such as keep, donate, sell, or trash, with organization and deep cleaning integrated into the process. As of early April, progress was at 35% completion with 12 boxes donated to Saint Helena Charity. To address concerns about meeting the deadline, a revised strategy was implemented that included setting specific daily goals, prioritizing high-impact areas, applying the KonMari method, scheduling regular decluttering sessions, and involving partners and friends to increase efficiency. A detailed weekly plan was created to allocate time effectively, with flexibility to adjust based on progress. Communication and preparation for helpers were emphasized, along with celebrating milestones and documenting progress to maintain motivation. The project also incorporated a system for managing donations to streamline trips and maintain momentum. Overall, the approach evolved from a broad initial plan to a more structured, collaborative, and adaptive process aimed at ensuring the decluttering goal was met on time while maintaining organization and motivation throughout.",
