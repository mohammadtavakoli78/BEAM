You also experimented with ingredient adjustments, like optimizing oil types for cake moistness and enhancing sourdough flavor and texture by adding malt powder and other ingredients. Throughout, you addressed practical challenges, including kitchen organization strategies to separate vegan and non-vegan ingredients and scheduling baking lessons around fixed weekly commitments.
