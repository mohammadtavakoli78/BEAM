Initially, the user struggled with emotional pain and sought strategies to process feelings, including journaling, therapy, and establishing new routines. To protect emotional well-being, the user set firm communication boundaries, insisting on email-only contact and involving a mediator to handle sensitive discussions, especially regarding custody and visitation. The user committed to avoiding direct contact for a set period, employing support systems and mindfulness techniques to maintain this boundary. As joint custody discussions arose, the user approached them cautiously, seeking legal advice and proposing mediation to facilitate structured negotiations focused on the children's best interests. Supervised visits were scheduled, prompting the user to prepare emotionally and practically by setting clear boundaries, involving supervisors when necessary, and focusing interactions on the children to avoid conflict. The user faced challenges such as missed visits by Sarah, which led to mediator involvement and feelings of guilt, but processed these emotions through therapy and support networks. Throughout, the user maintained self-care routines, including affirmations, physical activity, and social connections, to support emotional resilience. The holiday visits added anxiety, but the user planned carefully with therapist guidance, mindfulness, and support from friends. After the visits, the user reflected on mood improvements and sought strategies to sustain progress. Overall, the user navigated a multifaceted journey balancing emotional recovery, co-parenting responsibilities, and boundary enforcement, leveraging professional support, mediation, and personal coping mechanisms to manage the evolving situation effectively.",
