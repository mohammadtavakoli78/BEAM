Later, you explored more advanced scheduling options by switching to APScheduler, learning how to schedule posts at intervals and specific times, and how to handle errors and keep the scheduler running reliably. You also addressed authentication challenges with Twitter's API, moving from OAuth 1.0a to OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens, and discussed secure handling of credentials and token refresh strategies. Finally, you integrated posting functionalities into a unified, object-oriented interface for multiple platforms, adding robust error handling and logging to ensure reliable and maintainable automation. Throughout these stages, your project evolved from simple scheduling to a sophisticated, secure, and flexible social media automation system.",

Additionally, it should explain implementing OAuth 1.0a authentication for Twitter with secure token storage using Fernet encryption, paralleling the Facebook OAuth 2.0 flow.
