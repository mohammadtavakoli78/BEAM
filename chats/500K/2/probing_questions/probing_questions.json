Initial implementations focused on extracting work experience, skills, and education using basic keyword searches and sentence segmentation. Subsequent improvements introduced named entity recognition (NER) for more precise extraction of job titles, companies, and educational institutions, alongside modularizing the code and enhancing error handling in the Flask API. Debugging efforts addressed issues with PDF text extraction, including handling NoneType errors and improving logging for better traceability. A structured project timeline was established to meet a February 15, 2024 deadline, prioritizing environment setup, core functionality, testing, and documentation. Performance profiling using cProfile was integrated to identify bottlenecks, and caching strategies evolved from simple in-memory caches to Redis-backed caching for repeated analyses, improving response times. Keyword matching was optimized by refining regex patterns and precompiling them, while NLP pipelines were enhanced by combining stopword removal and lemmatization for more accurate keyword extraction. To reduce Flask app startup time, lazy-loading of spaCy models and consideration of smaller models were implemented. The resume analysis was further refined by training custom NER models for job titles, with guidance on dataset size and training processes. Finally, weighted scoring algorithms for skill matching were optimized for latency, incorporating prioritization of skills and experience levels, and caching strategies were adjusted to balance memory usage and performance. Visualization techniques were suggested to represent weighted skill scores effectively. Throughout, the project demonstrated iterative refinement, integrating technical, performance, and project management aspects to build a robust, efficient resume analyzer system.",
