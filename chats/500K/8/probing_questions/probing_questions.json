Starting with parabolas, the vertex form \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\) was established, confirming vertex coordinates and the role of the parameter \\( p \\) in defining the focal length and directrix. The method of completing the square was detailed as a means to convert general quadratic equations into vertex form, facilitating the identification of vertex and focus. Problems involving finding parabola equations from vertex and focus coordinates demonstrated the practical use of these concepts, including calculating \\( p \\) as the distance between vertex and focus and applying it to derive the equation. The reflective property of parabolas was explored in depth, illustrating how incoming parallel rays reflect through the focus, with applications in parabolic mirrors and satellite dishes, supported by slope and normal vector calculations to confirm the reflection paths. Transitioning to ellipses, the geometric definition involving the constant sum of distances to two foci was used to derive the standard ellipse equation, with explicit steps showing how to express distances in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), isolate radicals, and simplify to the canonical form. The relationships among \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) were clarified, including how \\( c^2 = a^2 - b^2 \\) governs the ellipse's shape and positioning of vertices and foci. Tangent lines to ellipses were addressed through implicit differentiation and the general tangent line formula, providing methods to find slopes and equations at specific points. For hyperbolas, the geometric definition based on the constant difference of distances to foci was explained, with the standard form \\( \\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \\) and the relationship \\( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\) detailed. The positions of vertices and foci were verified, correcting common misconceptions, and the derivation from the geometric definition was demonstrated through algebraic manipulation of distance expressions. Throughout, the connections between the conics\u2019 algebraic forms, geometric definitions, and physical properties were emphasized, illustrating how understanding these relationships enables solving diverse problems and applying conic sections in physics and engineering contexts.
