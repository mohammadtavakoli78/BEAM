With Kendra as your mentor, you received valuable guidance on improving your lighting techniques and portfolio, which you applied through practice and feedback. You also explored ways to show appreciation for Kendra\u2019s mentorship, including writing personal notes and collaborating on projects. As you prepared for new opportunities, such as co-leading a beginner\u2019s workshop and collaborating on a street photography project, you balanced learning new styles with refining your existing skills. You focused on improving your editing workflow and lighting skills, especially for specific events like weddings, incorporating Kendra\u2019s advice and practicing with equipment like reflectors and off-camera flash. Finally, you prepared to share your knowledge by planning a speech on wedding lighting, addressing challenges like mixed lighting scenarios, and engaging with the photography community.
