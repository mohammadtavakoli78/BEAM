BATCH 1 PLAN  
• **Time Anchor:** March 15, 2024, 09:00 CET  
• **Personal Introduction:** I’m Christina, a colour technologist from Port Michael, excited to build a weather app using JavaScript and OpenWeather API v2.5.  
• **Project Initialization:** Starting with vanilla JavaScript ES2021, HTML5, CSS3, targeting OpenWeather API endpoint `api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather`.  
• **Project Planning:** Scope includes fetching weather by city name, displaying temperature (°C), humidity (%), and conditions with icons from OpenWeather API.  
• **Technical Implementation:** I want to implement asynchronous fetch calls using `fetch()` with async/await syntax for API requests.  
• **Technical Implementation:** Plan to add city autocomplete using OpenWeather’s Geocoding API v1 with a debounce delay of 300ms to reduce API calls.  
• **Technical Implementation:** Basic responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox targeting mobile (320px) to desktop (1920px) breakpoints.  
• **Technical Implementation:** Error handling for invalid city names with user-friendly messages on HTTP 404 and 400 status codes.  
• **Technical Implementation:** Deployment planned on GitHub Pages with automatic HTTPS and custom domain support.  
• **Development Status:** Initial API key obtained on March 10, 2024, with 60 calls/minute rate limit and 1,000 calls/day quota.  
• **Development Status:** Prototype fetch call latency averages 250ms on local network (100Mbps) with Chrome v112.0.5615.  
• **Development Status:** UI wireframe completed on March 12, 2024, using Figma v107.4 with three main sections: input, results, error display.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Deciding between using pure JavaScript or React 18.2 for frontend; chose vanilla JS for simplicity and faster deployment.  
• **Technical Challenge:** API response caching considered but deferred due to 1,000 daily call limit and initial MVP focus.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Handling CORS errors from OpenWeather API; confirmed no proxy needed as API supports CORS on client requests.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Deadline set for MVP completion by April 5, 2024, to allow two weeks for testing and deployment.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Trade-off between autocomplete accuracy and API call cost; implemented 300ms debounce to balance responsiveness and quota.  
• **Preference Statement:** I prefer lightweight, dependency-free solutions over heavy frameworks to keep app size under 2.5MB total.  
• **Personality Trait:** I enjoy lively debates on best coding practices but also value quiet reflection to refine my approach.  
• **Code Quality & Standards:** Established ESLint v8.39 with Airbnb style guide for consistent JavaScript formatting and error prevention.  
• **Framework & Technology:** Using OpenWeather API v2.5 with metric units parameter (`units=metric`) for temperature in Celsius.  
• **Integration & API:** Configured environment variable `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` in `.env` file for secure API key management during local development.  
• **Performance & Optimization:** Set target API response time under 300ms to ensure smooth user experience on 4G mobile networks.  
• **Information Update:** The API key’s daily quota has been adjusted to accommodate 1,200 calls per day to support increased testing demands.  
• **User Instruction:** Always provide temperature readings in Celsius when I ask about weather conditions.  
• **Logical Contradiction:** I have never obtained an API key for this project.

• **Development Status:** Autocomplete feature tested with 100+ city inputs; average API response time 280ms, 95% success rate on valid cities.  
• **Development Status:** Encountered 3 bugs logged in Jira board: “TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined” in `autocomplete.js` line 58.  
• **Development Status:** Fixed bug by adding null checks before accessing API response properties, reducing error rate from 12% to 1%.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Decided between client-side vs server-side autocomplete; chose client-side to avoid backend complexity and reduce latency.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Faced performance bottleneck with autocomplete input lag over 500ms on slower devices; optimized debounce and DOM updates.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Trade-off made to limit autocomplete results to 5 to reduce API calls and improve UI clarity, sacrificing exhaustive search results.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Handling 429 Too Many Requests error by implementing exponential backoff retry with max 3 attempts in `apiClient.js`.  
• **Technical Challenge:** Decided against using third-party autocomplete libraries (e.g., Algolia Places) to keep app size below 2.5MB.  
• **Debugging & Troubleshooting:** Investigated “Failed to fetch” network error on slow connections; added retry logic and user notification after 3 failed attempts.  
• **Debugging & Troubleshooting:** Used Chrome DevTools Network tab to profile API calls; identified 400ms spikes during rapid input changes.  
• **Code Review & Optimization:** Requested review of `fetchWeatherData()` async function for error handling and promise chaining improvements.  
• **Code Quality & Standards:** Added Prettier v2.8 for automatic code formatting on save, integrated with ESLint for consistent style enforcement.
