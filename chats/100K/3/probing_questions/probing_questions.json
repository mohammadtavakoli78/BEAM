Initially, you focused on building the basic HTML5 structure with sections for About, Skills, Projects, and Contact, using Bootstrap v5.3.0 to ensure responsiveness and clean design. You then implemented a color palette generator feature tailored to your skills as a Colour Technologist, integrating Python backend logic with a Bootstrap-styled frontend to allow users to input colors and generate palettes dynamically. Following that, you enhanced the site by adding a responsive project gallery with cards and modal popups for project details, addressing layout and modal functionality issues specific to Bootstrap 5.3.0. Concurrently, you developed a contact form with both HTML5 and custom JavaScript validation, ensuring smooth user experience and backend integration using Flask, while also focusing on SEO basics and performance optimizations to meet your Sprint 2 deadline. Throughout the process, you tackled challenges related to responsive design, image handling, modal behavior, and form validation, progressively refining your site to be both functional and user-friendly.",

Subsequently, you addressed image loading problems in a React project gallery, exploring potential causes like path errors, server configuration, and build process issues, and learned how to use server logs for deeper debugging. You also resolved JavaScript linking problems causing function reference errors by verifying file structure and script inclusion order. Finally, you implemented and refined retry logic with exponential backoff to handle intermittent server errors during contact form submissions, enhancing robustness and user feedback.
