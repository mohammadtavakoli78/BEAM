Initially, you shared household finances since 2020 and sought advice on whether this was a good strategy. You received guidance on the benefits and challenges of shared finances, including the importance of open communication, joint and separate accounts, and regular budget reviews. As concerns about day-to-day spending habits arose, you explored strategies like setting daily spending limits, maintaining transparency through sharing receipts, and using Excel to track expenses. Later, you made specific budget compromises, such as adjusting the dining out budget to $200 monthly, and received advice on how to validate and stick to this limit through planning and tracking. You also considered Alexis's suggestion to switch to a joint savings account to improve transparency, emphasizing shared financial goals and regular check-ins. Further, you agreed to increase the grocery budget and evaluated how additional freelance income could support your financial goals. Finally, you planned to reduce your work hours to support Alexis's freelance business and focus more on financial planning, adjusting your budget accordingly and exploring ways to maintain your financial goals despite reduced income. Throughout, your financial management approach has become more structured, communicative, and adaptive to changing circumstances.",
