Later, you drew inspiration from Robert's 1985 essay on gender studies, learning how to integrate his ideas into your own work while maintaining originality and proper citation. As you developed your essay, you faced decisions about prioritizing Robert's feedback, particularly his recommendation to strengthen warrants for claims on gender bias, balancing this with other essay improvements. Subsequently, you planned how to manage your time between refining your essay for journal submission and collaborating on a conference paper with Greg, creating a detailed schedule to meet both deadlines effectively. Most recently, after receiving a high grade, you reviewed your progress and prepared for a Zoom meeting with Robert by outlining your achievements, planning your conference paper, and identifying areas for further feedback and improvement. Throughout this process, your work with Robert has evolved from initial preparation to deepening academic development and strategic planning for publication and presentation.",
