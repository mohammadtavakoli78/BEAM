Initially, you sought to grasp probability as a ratio using simple examples like coin tosses and dice rolls, where you learned that probability is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes, such as 1:2 for heads on a coin and 1:6 for rolling a 4 on a die. Building on this, you explored more complex events like rolling an even number on a die, which involved counting multiple favorable outcomes and simplifying ratios. We then clarified the difference between independent and mutually exclusive events with examples from coin tosses and dice rolls, including how to calculate combined probabilities. Finally, you delved into conditional probability, understanding how the likelihood of one event changes given another event has occurred, with practical examples involving coins, dice, and even card draws. Throughout, your learning journey showed a clear progression from basic concepts to more nuanced probability topics, supported by step-by-step explanations and practical applications.",
