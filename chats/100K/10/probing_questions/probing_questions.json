You then addressed passive voice reduction, decreasing it from 18% to 10% by applying Carla's editing checklist and actively rewriting sentences in active voice, supported by consistent peer feedback and writing tools. To enhance tone consistency, you leveraged Jasper AI for a 22% improvement and explored additional AI tools such as ProWritingAid and Grammarly Premium, combined with techniques like defining tone and iterative editing. Most recently, integrating ProWritingAid further improved your grammar accuracy by 10%, prompting consideration of supplementary resources like workshops, books, and peer reviews to continue advancing your writing skills.
