Early development focused on implementing core functionalities such as user registration, login, and managing expenses, followed by adding data visualization using Matplotlib to display spending patterns. A detailed project schedule was then created to ensure timely delivery of the MVP by April 15, 2024, breaking down tasks into phases covering authentication, transaction management, analytics, and deployment. As the project neared completion, security improvements were addressed, including stronger password hashing, token-based authentication, role-based access control, and input validation to harden the application before launch. Finally, documentation practices were enhanced by structuring API endpoint details and architecture decisions in Confluence, incorporating tables and diagrams to facilitate collaboration and feedback. Throughout this process, the project demonstrated clear progression from foundational development to security hardening and thorough documentation.",

Initially, you focused on implementing password hashing using Werkzeug.security, ensuring passwords were securely hashed with the default pbkdf2:sha256 method and verified correctly during login. Next, you tackled database integrity issues, specifically resolving a UNIQUE constraint error in your SQLite transactions table by verifying UUID uniqueness and adding error handling to manage insertion conflicts. You then enhanced your application's robustness by incorporating proper error handling for database operational errors in your Flask routes, ensuring that such errors were logged and returned appropriate HTTP 500 responses. Additionally, you addressed frontend security concerns by troubleshooting CSRF token errors in your Flask-WTF forms, confirming correct token inclusion, enabling CSRF protection, and verifying browser cookie settings to ensure tokens were properly handled. Finally, you implemented an account lockout mechanism using Redis to limit login attempts, refining your approach with atomic operations, expiry management, and resetting counters upon successful login to improve security and efficiency. This sequence of improvements reflects a thoughtful progression from basic security measures to comprehensive error handling and user protection features in your application.",
