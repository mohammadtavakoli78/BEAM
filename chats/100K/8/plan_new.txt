• **Goal Setting:** Target to complete cover letter draft by March 25, revise by April 5, and submit by April 10 to allow buffer time.  
• **Conflict - Time Management:** I must choose between attending Greg’s April 2 coaching session or Leslie’s April 3 networking event; both overlap.  
• **Conflict - Financial:** Considering investing $150 in a premium cover letter template or using free online tools; unsure which yields better results.  
• **Conflict - Professional Choice:** Debating whether to emphasize my 40 years’ experience or focus on recent digital projects in the letter.  
• **Preference Statement:** I prefer a direct, no-fluff writing style that highlights measurable impact rather than flowery language.

• **Information Update:** I have adjusted my goal to complete the cover letter draft by March 28, allowing more time for revisions before the April 10 submission.  
• **User Instruction:** Always use bullet points for lists when I ask about formatting options.  
• **Logical Contradiction:** I have never collaborated remotely with my child Michael on any projects.
