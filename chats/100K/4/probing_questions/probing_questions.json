First, we verified whether a triangle with sides 8 cm, 15 cm, and 17 cm is right-angled by applying the Pythagorean theorem, confirming that it satisfies the condition for a right triangle. Next, we learned how to calculate the area of triangles using different methods: Heron's formula was applied to a triangle with sides 7 cm, 24 cm, and 25 cm, resulting in an area of 84 cm\u00b2, while for a triangle with a known base and height (10 cm and 6 cm), we compared the base-height formula and Heron's formula, concluding that the base-height formula is more efficient in such cases. We also examined how to find the length of a median in a triangle with sides 9 cm, 12 cm, and 15 cm using the median length formula, arriving at approximately 12.82 cm. Finally, we discussed the property that a median divides a triangle into two smaller triangles of equal area, demonstrated with the 8 cm, 15 cm, 17 cm triangle and generalized to all triangles, including the 7 cm, 24 cm, 25 cm triangle. This progression shows a comprehensive understanding of triangle properties, area calculations, and median characteristics.",

Initially, you explored the SSS similarity criterion by comparing two triangles with sides 6 cm, 8 cm, 10 cm and 9 cm, 12 cm, 15 cm, learning how to calculate and apply scale factors to confirm similarity. Then, you moved on to proving congruence using the ASA criterion, where you learned to identify corresponding angles and the included side, and how to structure a formal proof. Subsequently, you compared the SAS and ASA methods for a triangle with given sides and angles, understanding the conditions and efficiency of each approach. Later, you examined a formal proof of similarity using the SAS similarity criterion with sides in a 2:3 ratio and equal included angles, reinforcing the connection between proportional sides and angle equality. Finally, you addressed why SSA is not a valid congruence criterion through a counterexample involving triangles with sides 6, 8, 10 cm and 9, 12, 15 cm, recognizing the ambiguity and difference between similarity and congruence in such cases. Throughout, your grasp of geometric principles evolved from basic ratio calculations to formal proofs and critical evaluation of congruence criteria, equipping you with a comprehensive foundation for applying these concepts in design and construction contexts.",
