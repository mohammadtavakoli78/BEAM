We explored the geometric nature of geodesics as semicircles orthogonal to the x-axis or vertical lines, including how to find their centers and radii, and how to visualize and plot them both conceptually and with Python code. Later, you compared the direct formula method with numerical integration of the metric for calculating geodesic lengths, understanding the pros and cons of each approach and how to decide between them based on problem complexity and precision needs. Finally, you learned how to set up the integral for numerical verification of geodesic length along a semicircle, confirming that numerical results align with the formula, solidifying your comprehensive understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of geodesics in this model.",
