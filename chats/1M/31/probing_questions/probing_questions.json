The user also practiced regional dialects such as Hiroshima and Osaka dialects, integrating these into real-life conversations and cultural contexts like Hanami picnics and street food tours, while receiving guidance on avoiding common linguistic and cultural mistakes. Safety and risk management were addressed by balancing language and cultural immersion with emergency preparedness, including memorizing emergency phrases and procedures. The user\u2019s confidence grew through practical application, such as holding conversations with locals and using dialects, supported by continuous feedback and structured learning plans. Additionally, the user evaluated resources like advanced language courses and cultural tours (e.g., Dotonbori street food tour), weighing costs against benefits for immersive experiences.
