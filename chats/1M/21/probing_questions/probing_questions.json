Initially, meeting with the real estate agent Selim Kaya marked the start, with emphasis on setting a competitive listing price supported by a detailed Comparative Market Analysis and recent appraisals confirming a $420,000 valuation. The timing of the sale was optimized by starting in early spring to leverage market activity and buyer interest. Extensive home preparation included decluttering, staging with a $1,200 budget through Elegant Spaces focusing on high-impact areas like the living room and backyard, and completing necessary repairs such as a roof fix finalized by April 3, which was highlighted as a selling point to build buyer confidence. Professional marketing efforts incorporated a scheduled photography session with FocusLens and a Matterport 3D virtual tour to enhance online listings and attract buyers. Throughout, Selim provided critical support by recommending reliable contractors, assisting with paperwork and legal guidance, and managing negotiations, including advising on counteroffers and commission structures. The negotiation phase involved rejecting an initial $400,000 offer and countering at $415,000, justified by market data and home improvements, with flexibility on terms to facilitate agreement. The timeline was carefully managed with clear deadlines for listing, offers, and closing, supported by detailed checklists and communication strategies. Financial considerations included analyzing commission fees, closing costs, and repair expenses to maximize net profit, while contingency plans addressed potential lender delays and additional repair requests. The final stages involved preparing for contract signing with thorough document review and coordination. Overall, the sale process was a complex, multi-faceted journey requiring strategic planning, resource allocation, expert collaboration, and adaptive decision-making to achieve a successful and timely home sale.",
