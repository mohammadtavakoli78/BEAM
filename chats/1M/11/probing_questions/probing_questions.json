Time management techniques and detailed planning facilitated meeting critical deadlines, such as paper submissions and workshop preparations.

Technical readiness is also critical, involving testing equipment and familiarizing oneself with virtual platforms or venue logistics. During the events, active engagement is emphasized through attending key sessions, participating in discussions, networking proactively both in-person and via social media, and managing energy with scheduled breaks. Post-event follow-up includes sending personalized thank-you messages, connecting on professional networks, sharing insights, and maintaining ongoing communication to foster collaborations. Throughout this process, balancing time commitments with existing professional obligations is managed by prioritizing tasks, delegating when possible, and using effective time management techniques like time blocking and the Pomodoro method. Financial considerations are addressed by optimizing budget use, prioritizing high-impact activities, and leveraging free or low-cost resources. Additionally, strategic partnerships, such as co-hosting events, require clear communication, defined roles, shared goals, and joint marketing efforts.
