Over time, both cases involved implementing consistent sleep schedules, relaxation techniques, and environmental adjustments like blackout blinds and caffeine cut-offs. You also explored strategies such as digital detoxes, gratitude journaling, and CBT-I techniques to further enhance sleep quality.

Setting a deadline to acquire and install the curtains helped you stay focused on improving your sleep environment promptly. Alongside environmental changes, you developed a structured evening routine incorporating stretching, reading, journaling, and meditation to promote physical and mental relaxation, reduce anxiety, and regulate your circadian rhythm. You also implemented monthly bedroom cleaning and airing schedules to maintain air quality and a comfortable atmosphere. Throughout this process, you monitored progress, adjusted routines, and integrated tools like diffusers and white noise machines to further optimize your sleep setting.
