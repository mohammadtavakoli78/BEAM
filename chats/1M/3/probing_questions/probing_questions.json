Initially, you encountered issues with the Alpha Vantage API's rate limiting, which you addressed by implementing asynchronous requests using asyncio and aiohttp to efficiently manage API calls without exceeding limits. Next, you expanded the system architecture by designing a microservices setup with Flask and message queues like RabbitMQ to enable seamless communication between data fetching, ML prediction, and trade execution modules. To ensure high availability and robustness, you incorporated retry logic with exponential backoff to handle HTTP 429 errors gracefully, improving the reliability of your stock price fetcher. You further optimized performance by introducing Redis caching to reduce redundant API calls and dynamically managing delays between requests. Finally, you sought to enhance your testing coverage and model evaluation by adding comprehensive pytest tests and integrating classification metrics such as precision and recall into your LSTM model training pipeline. Throughout these phases, you progressively refined your system to be more efficient, scalable, and resilient.",
