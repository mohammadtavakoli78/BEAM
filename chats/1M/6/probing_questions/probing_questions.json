We explored foundational concepts such as computing partial derivatives using both limit definitions and shortcut rules, confirming their equivalence and applicability to more complex functions. Your understanding deepened as we examined gradient vectors, learning how to compute them, interpret their geometric significance as directions of steepest ascent, and visualize their perpendicularity to level curves using graphing tools. Additionally, you tackled directional derivatives, applying the formula \\(D_u f = \nabla f \\cdot u\\) to specific functions and points, reinforcing the connection between gradients and rates of change in arbitrary directions. Throughout, you also engaged with advanced topics like Clairaut's theorem on mixed partial derivatives, solidifying your conceptual foundation.
