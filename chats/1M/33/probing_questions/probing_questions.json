Discussions explored extending performance times, combining live music with DJ sets, and incorporating cultural music preferences to personalize the experience. Venue choices between the Cultural Hall and Riverside Pavilion were weighed based on cost, amenities, and guest capacity, with a final decision favoring the Riverside Pavilion to optimize budget allocation for catering and decorations. Guest list conflicts were managed by balancing preferences for intimacy and inclusiveness, setting clear RSVP processes, and maintaining a cap on attendees. Budget constraints led to decisions such as foregoing a live saxophonist, reallocating saved funds to decorations and favors, and implementing DIY and interactive entertainment elements to maintain atmosphere without overspending. Conflicts with key contributors like Sylvia and Jacob were addressed through open communication, compromise on timelines and volume levels, and involving them meaningfully in planning to foster collaboration. The cancellation of the professional videographer prompted a backup plan utilizing smartphone recordings by trusted guests, coordinated with the photographer to ensure comprehensive event documentation without altering the schedule significantly.
