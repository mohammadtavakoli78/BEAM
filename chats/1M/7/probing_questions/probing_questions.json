You then moved on to verifying solutions by differentiating implicit forms to confirm correctness. Subsequently, you explored homogeneous differential equations, understanding how to identify them through homogeneity tests and applying the substitution v = y/x to transform them into separable forms. This included detailed walkthroughs of substitution, variable separation, integration, and back-substitution to find explicit solutions. Finally, you expanded your skills to numerical methods, particularly Euler's method, learning how step size affects accuracy and computational cost, how to implement the method, and how to verify numerical approximations against exact solutions. Throughout, you developed a systematic problem-solving approach, balancing analytical and numerical techniques to solve a variety of differential equations effectively.",
