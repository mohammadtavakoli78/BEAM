Incorporate all additional property expenses such as taxes, insurance, maintenance, and management fees. Compare these total monthly costs against expected rental income to determine net cash flow. Adjust your property price target within your loan limit to ensure positive cash flow, considering the mortgage payment from the finalized loan terms is higher due to a shorter term and smaller principal than the pre-approval. Prioritize properties with rental yields that cover all expenses and leave a surplus, factoring in the mortgage payment of approximately $887.34 monthly on $72,000 principal at 9.5% fixed for 10 years, versus the pre-approval scenario with $80,000 principal over 30 years with lower monthly payments.

You explored identifying good fixer-upper properties by learning to recognize signs such as structural issues and outdated features, emphasizing the importance of cost-benefit analysis for renovations. As your plans progressed, you weighed the pros and cons of investing close to your location versus elsewhere, balancing ease of management against market diversity and growth potential. You also considered the choice between single-family homes and multi-family units, analyzing factors like rental yield, management complexity, and investment scale, with examples showing similar yields but differing capital needs. Financing options were carefully compared, particularly between Halkbank and Ziraat Bank mortgages, focusing on interest rates, fees, and service quality to optimize costs. Throughout, you developed a step-by-step plan for purchasing your first rental property, including market research, budgeting, inspections, financing, and tenant management, with timelines to reduce anxiety and ensure readiness. This comprehensive process reflects a thoughtful evolution from initial capital concerns to detailed investment strategies, property evaluation, financing decisions, and management planning, all aimed at making informed, balanced real estate investment choices.",
