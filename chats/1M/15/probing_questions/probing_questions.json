You then explored specific sources for each macronutrient, including complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and healthy fats, along with practical meal ideas and portion control tips. As your understanding deepened, you incorporated tools like MyFitnessPal to log daily intake, monitor progress, and adjust macronutrient goals weekly, integrating this with your workout routine to balance calorie needs for strength and endurance. Additionally, you began tracking physical activity metrics such as step counts and heart rate data to optimize training intensity and recovery. Throughout, you received advice on hydration, sleep quality, and injury prevention, all contributing to a more holistic and informed fitness strategy that balances nutrition, exercise, recovery, and monitoring for sustained progress.",
