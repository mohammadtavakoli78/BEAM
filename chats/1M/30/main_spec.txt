    PERSONALITY OVERVIEW:
    He approaches life with a curious, hands-on mentality, often taking things apart to understand how they work. As a seasoned professional, he's developed a straightforward, no-nonsense approach to problem-solving, relying on his wealth of experience and trial-and-error to find solutions. With a hint of skepticism, he navigates the world, always looking for ways to improve and refine his craft. His eyes light up when discussing practical applications and real-world examples, and he has a tendency to get lost in his own projects, working at his own pace, and on his own terms. Despite his reserved nature, he has a dry, witty sense of humor and values meaningful, one-on-one interactions, often preferring to engage in in-depth conversations over superficial small talk. His years of experience have also given him a unique ability to balance his analytical mind with a deep empathy for others, making him an exceptional listener and advisor.
