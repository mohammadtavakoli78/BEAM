Throughout, attention was given to balancing excitement with stress management by delegating tasks and allowing for breaks. The integration of cherished family memories via slideshows and shared stories further enriched the gathering, while strategies to handle potential conflicts and ensure inclusivity maintained a harmonious environment.
