Concurrently, you and Andrew evaluated apartment options, balancing his desire for more space with your priorities of budget, commute, and safety, ultimately agreeing to prioritize the Mevlana Street apartment after collaborative discussions and compromises. Financially, you navigated securing a 50,000 TRY down payment contribution from your mother, Crystal, addressing concerns about approaching her, negotiating repayment terms, and establishing a manageable 5-year repayment plan with monthly installments of 900 TRY. To support this, you implemented budgeting strategies including reducing discretionary spending and increasing income, while also planning for repairs and coordinating moving logistics. Throughout, you maintained open communication with all parties involved, ensuring transparency and trust, and took practical steps to stay on track with repayments and home purchase preparations.",
