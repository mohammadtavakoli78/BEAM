Parallel efforts involved optimizing MQTT-based agent communication, scaling message throughput to hundreds of messages per second with low latency, and integrating TLS 1.3 for secure message passing.

You also tackled issues related to outdated dependencies and test baselines, improving error diagnosis and regression test reliability.
