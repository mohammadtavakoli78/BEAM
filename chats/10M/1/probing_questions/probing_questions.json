Initially, you focused on designing a modular system capable of handling high daily query volumes with strict response time and uptime requirements, considering load balancing and caching strategies. Subsequently, you explored advanced load balancing algorithms and health check implementations to ensure high availability and efficient traffic distribution. You then incorporated distributed caching solutions like Redis Cluster to enhance scalability and fault tolerance. Later, you integrated microservices architecture with container orchestration and message queues to improve modularity and inter-service communication. Throughout these discussions, you refined deployment strategies, CI/CD pipeline configurations, and monitoring setups to maintain high deployment success rates and system reliability, culminating in a comprehensive, scalable, and resilient system design.",
