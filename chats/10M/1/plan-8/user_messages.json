I'm using ELK Stack 8.11.1, and my current configuration is a mix of LDAP and native realm authentications. \nHere's a snippet of my current `kibana.yml` configuration:\n```yml\nxpack:\n  security:\n    authc:\n      realms:\n        native:\n          order: 0\n        ldap:\n          order: 1\n          url: \"ldap://ldap-server:389\"\n          user_dn_template: \"cn={0},ou=people,dc=example,dc=com\"\n```\nI'd like to add role-based access control to restrict certain dashboard views to specific user groups. For example, I have a \"developers\" group that should only have access to the \"app_logs\" and \"system_logs\" dashboard views. How can I achieve this using ELK's built-in security features?\n```python\n# Example of how I'd like to define roles and permissions\nroles:\n  developers:\n    - app_logs\n    - system_logs\n  administrators:\n    - all_dashboard_views\n```\nCan you provide an example of how I can define these roles and permissions in my `kibana.yml` file, and how I can assign users to these roles using LDAP groups? ->-> 7,16"
