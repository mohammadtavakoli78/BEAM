Parallel to John\u2019s mentorship, you balanced family support and peer feedback, integrating diverse perspectives to refine your skills and maintain motivation. Performance opportunities, such as gigs and open mic nights facilitated through Harmony Hub, provided practical platforms to apply your learning and build confidence. Regular reviews and reflection guides from John encouraged structured self-assessment, enhancing your focus and enabling you to set clear, actionable goals. Managing challenges like pre-gig tension and shaky hands was addressed through both mental and physical preparation techniques, supported by mentor insights.
