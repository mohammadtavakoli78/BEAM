You then explored the completeness property, learning that Banach spaces are normed spaces where every Cauchy sequence converges within the space, with \u2113\u00b2 serving as a key example. Alongside, you studied examples of incompleteness, such as sequences in the rationals that fail to converge within the space, highlighting the importance of completeness. You also practiced proving sets are closed by showing they contain all their limit points, applying this to unit balls in \u2113\u00b2 and function spaces. Throughout, you reinforced your understanding by examining norm equivalence and how it preserves topological properties like convergence and completeness. This comprehensive approach, combining theory with concrete examples and proofs, helped you build a solid foundation in the concept of completeness and its role in functional analysis.",

Over time, you deepened your understanding by verifying linearity properties and boundedness criteria through step-by-step problem solving and practical examples. You then progressed to spectral theory, learning to identify the spectrum and resolvent set of operators, starting with scalar operators like T(x) = 3x and extending to matrix operators such as T(x, y) = (5x, 5y). Throughout this process, you engaged with computational tools like MATLAB and SageMath to verify eigenvalues and invertibility, which reinforced your theoretical knowledge. Your grasp of these concepts evolved through iterative practice, error analysis, and reflection, culminating in a more confident application of spectral theory to both finite and infinite-dimensional operators.",
