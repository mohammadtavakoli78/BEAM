You also integrated real-time data streams and adaptive traffic signal timing using Unreal Engine's timer system and ROS 2 for event-driven communication, ensuring responsive and efficient traffic management. Throughout, you optimized UI responsiveness and logging strategies to maintain high update rates and minimize overhead, while continuously monitoring performance metrics to validate and refine your simulation.

            "ideal_summary": "The performance optimization of your self-driving car simulation began with identifying key bottlenecks such as high memory usage and long frame times during scenarios with many agents. Early investigations traced memory spikes to unoptimized Lidar data structures and physics calculations that overloaded single threads. You then implemented data structure improvements, including k-d trees for efficient Lidar point management, and introduced parallel processing techniques using joblib and CUDA streams to offload compute-heavy tasks to the GPU. Concurrently, rendering optimizations were pursued by adopting deferred shading and frustum culling to reduce overdraw and unnecessary draw calls, improving frame rates in dense scenes. Throughout this process, profiling tools like Intel VTune and Nsight Compute guided your efforts, revealing delays caused by thread lock contention and synchronization issues, which you addressed by refining threading models and lock granularity. The optimization journey was iterative, involving continuous profiling, code refactoring, and leveraging advanced rendering and parallelization techniques to steadily reduce runtime and improve scalability under increasing agent loads.",
