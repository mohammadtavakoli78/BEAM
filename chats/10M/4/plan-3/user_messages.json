I think I need help understanding the concept of Fourier coefficients and how they relate to the functions I'm analyzing. Can you provide an explanation and clarify the difference between even and odd functions, like f(x) = x² and f(x) = x, and how they affect the Fourier series coefficients? I'd like to see an example of how to compute the coefficients for f(x) = x² and understand the process behind it. ->-> 4,33"
